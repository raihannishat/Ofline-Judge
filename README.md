# Ofline-Judge
This is an offline judge, it can check the code offline just like online judge. I have different 	problems I have already created the output file of the solution, if you solve any problem then a 	new output file is generated for your solution. The output file of your solution is compared with the 	output file that I was created. This way your various solutions are checked.
